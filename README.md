# Human Phenotype Image Scraper

This project scrapes images from the [Human Phenotypes](http://humanphenotypes.net/) website and organizes them by male and female phenotypes. Using AI, the tool lets users upload their own photos to find the closest matching phenotype, showing how similar they are to various phenotypes.
## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Automatically retrieves images of human phenotypes from the website.
- **Image Organization**: Creates a folder containing all downloaded images, categorized by gender and phenotype.
- **Distance Measurement**: Users can upload their photos to calculate the visual distance between their image and the phenotypes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the scraper to download images.
3. Upload a photo to compare with the downloaded phenotypes.
